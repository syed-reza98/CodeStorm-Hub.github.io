# Suggestions & Improvements

## Accessibility
- Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, modals, sliders, FAQ toggles) have ARIA labels and proper keyboard navigation.
- Announce dynamic content changes to screen readers (audit JS for completeness).
- Maintain visible focus indicators for all interactive elements.

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Audit CSS breakpoints for consistency and completeness.
- Improve mobile navigation (hamburger menu, touch/swipe support for sliders).
- Test all layouts on various devices for overflow, spacing, and touch targets.

## Performance
- Optimize all images for lazy loading and correct sizing.
- Minify CSS and JS for production (manual step, no build tool).
- Audit for unused CSS/JS and remove dead code.

## UI/UX
- Enhance color contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA compliance).
- Ensure consistent use of CSS custom properties for theming.
- Improve button and link styles for better tap/click feedback.
- Add micro-interactions (e.g., button hover, modal open/close animations).

## SEO
- Verify meta tags, OpenGraph, and schema.org markup on all pages.
- Ensure robots.txt and sitemap are up-to-date.

## PWA Features
- Consider implementing a service worker for offline support and faster repeat visits (see `main.js` comment).

## Content Management
- Use Jekyll includes/layouts for reusable sections to reduce duplication.
- Document how to add/edit services, portfolio projects, and team members in the instructions.

# Bug Fixes & Implementation

- **ARIA & Keyboard Navigation:** Audit all interactive elements for missing ARIA attributes and keyboard event handlers. Fix any missing or incorrect attributes.
- **Mobile Menu:** Ensure hamburger menu toggles correctly and traps focus when open. Fix any issues with menu closing on navigation or outside click.
- **Image Optimization:** Check for any images missing `loading="lazy"` and add it. Compress large images.
- **Color Contrast:** Use a color contrast checker to identify and fix any low-contrast text or UI elements.
- **Minification:** Manually minify `style.css` and `main.js` for production deployment.
- **FAQ Accordion:** Ensure FAQ toggles are fully accessible and work with keyboard navigation.
- **Portfolio Modal:** Confirm modal opens/closes correctly, traps focus, and is accessible.
- **Touch/Swipe Support:** Test testimonial slider and portfolio filter for mobile swipe gestures; fix any issues.
- **Service Worker:** If PWA features are desired, implement and register a service worker in `main.js`.
